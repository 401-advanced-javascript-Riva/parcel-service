# parcel-service
An event-driven application that uses built-in Node.js events to simulate realtime package delivery, networked events using TCP Creation , socket.io implementation and queue logic

** Author: Riva Davidowski**

### Phase 1:

In this first phase, I setup a system of events and handlers, with the intent being to change out the eventing system as I go, but keeping the handlers themselves largely the same. The task of “delivering a package” doesn’t change (the handler), even if the mechanism for triggering that task (the event) does.
